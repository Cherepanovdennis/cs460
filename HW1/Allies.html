        <dd>The British Empire fought throughout the entire world during World War II. This ranged from the beaches of Europe, Africa, and even the pacific. Before the war, Britain attempted
        to prevent the war through a method called appeasement. It was a rather poor policy as it allowed nazi germany to gather resources and territory that allowed it to become the military
        powerhouse that would go on to dominate most of Europe. When the war broke out, Britain was woefully unpreppared and had to adapt its industry quickly in order to not be overrun.
        this led to them creating multiple military marvals and concepts that are even used today. </dd>
