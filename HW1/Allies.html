            <dt>The British Empire</dt>
            <dd>
                The British Empire fought throughout the entire world during World War II. This ranged from the beaches of Europe, Africa, and even the pacific. Before the war, Britain attempted
                to prevent the war through a method called appeasement. It was a rather poor policy as it allowed nazi germany to gather resources and territory that allowed it to become the military
                powerhouse that would go on to dominate most of Europe. When the war broke out, Britain was woefully unpreppared and had to adapt its industry quickly in order to not be overrun.
                this led to them creating multiple military marvals and concepts that are even used today.

                The military history of the United States in World War II covers
                the war against the Axis powers, starting with the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.
                During the first two years of World War II, the United States had maintained formal neutrality
                as made official in the Quarantine Speech delivered by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937,
                while supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with war material through the Lend-Lease Act which
                was signed into law on March 11, 1941, as well as deploying the U.S. military to replace the British invasion
                forces in Iceland. Following the "Greer incident" Roosevelt publicly confirmed the "shoot on sight" order
                on September 11, 1941, effectively declaring naval war on Germany and Italy in the Battle of the Atlantic.[1]
                In the Pacific Theater, there was unofficial early U.S. combat activity such as the Flying Tigers. </dd>
            

            <dt>Free France</dt>

            <dd>
                The military history of France during World War II covers three periods. From 1939 until 1940, which witnessed a war against Germany by the French Third Republic.
                The period from 1940 until 1945, which saw competition between Vichy France and the Free French Forces under General Charles de Gaulle for control of the overseas empire. And 1944,
                witnessing the landings of the Allies in France (Normandy, Provence), expelling the German Army and putting an end to the Vichy Regime.
            </dd>

            <dd>
                France and Britain declared war on Germany when they invaded Poland in September 1939. After the Phoney War from 1939 to 1940, within seven weeks,
                the Germans invaded and defeated France and forced the British off the continent. France formally surrendered to Germany.
            </dd>

            <dd>
                In August 1943, the de Gaulle and Giraud forces merged in a single chain of command subordinated to Anglo-American leadership, meanwhile opposing French forces on the Eastern Front were subordinated to Soviet or German leaderships.
                This in-exile French force together with the French Forces of the Interior (FFI) played a variable-scale role in the eventual liberation of France by the Western Allies and the defeat of Vichy France, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and the Japanese empire.
                Vichy France fought for control over the French overseas empire with the Free French forces, which were helped by Britain and the U.S. By 1943, all of the colonies, except for Indochina, had joined the Free French cause.[1]

            <dt> The Soviet Union</dt>
            <dd>
                The Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany on 23 August 1939. In addition to stipulations of non-aggression, the treaty included a secret protocol
                that divided territories of Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland into German and Soviet Union "spheres of influence", anticipating potential "territorial and
                political rearrangements" of these countries.[2] In October and November 1940,
                German-Soviet talks about the potential of joining the Axis took place in Berlin, nothing came from the talks since Hitler's Ideological goal was Lebensraum in the East.

                Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 starting World War II, Stalin waited until September 17th before launching his own invasion of Poland.[3]
                Part of the Karelia and Salla regions of Finland were annexed by the Soviet Union after the Winter War. This was followed by Soviet annexations of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and parts of Romania
                (Bessarabia, northern Bukovina and the Hertza region). It was known at the Nuremberg trials the existence of the secret protocol of the German–Soviet pact regarding the planned divisions of these territories.[2]
                The invasion of Bukovina violated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, as it went beyond the Soviet sphere of influence agreed with the Axis.[4]
