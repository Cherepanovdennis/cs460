                The British Empire fought throughout the entire world during World War II. This ranged from the beaches of Europe, Africa, and even the pacific. Before the war, Britain attempted
                to prevent the war through a method called appeasement. It was a rather poor policy as it allowed nazi germany to gather resources and territory that allowed it to become the military
                powerhouse that would go on to dominate most of Europe. When the war broke out, Britain was woefully unpreppared and had to adapt its industry quickly in order to not be overrun.
                this led to them creating multiple military marvals and concepts that are even used today.

            <dd> The military history of the United States in World War II covers 
                the war against the Axis powers, starting with the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. 
                During the first two years of World War II, the United States had maintained formal neutrality 
                as made official in the Quarantine Speech delivered by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937, 
                while supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with war material through the Lend-Lease Act which
                was signed into law on March 11, 1941, as well as deploying the U.S. military to replace the British invasion 
                forces in Iceland. Following the "Greer incident" Roosevelt publicly confirmed the "shoot on sight" order 
                on September 11, 1941, effectively declaring naval war on Germany and Italy in the Battle of the Atlantic.[1] 
                In the Pacific Theater, there was unofficial early U.S. combat activity such as the Flying Tigers.
