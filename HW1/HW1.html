        <h1>The Factions of WWII</h1>
        <p>
            World War II was fought by primarly the Allies and the Axis. The started in 1939 when Nazi Germany invaded Poland and ended when two nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, September 2nd 1945.
            This little test site is here to explain the primary weapons that were used by the Axis and allied forces.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Allied Forces</h2>
        <p>
            The allied armies consisted of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_during_the_Second_World_War">British</a>, and their commonwealth forces, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_France">
                Free France
            </a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_States_during_World_War_II">The United States</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army">Soviet Union.</a>
            They would continue to push forward into the heart of Germany and ultimately end the war in 1945.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>The Axis Forces</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
            The Axis forces were the combied forces of Italy, Japan, and Nazi Germany. These countries banded together due to a sense of nationalism or through convience. They would go on to lead a path of destruction and due to their beliefs of racial supremacy
            would go on to commit multiple war crimes and genocide.
        </p>

        <h2>Non-aligned Powers</h2>
        <p>These powers preffered to stay out of the conflict and instead focus on internal issues. Many of these countries preffered to stay 
        out due to the destructive nature of the first world war, and some preffered to stay unaligned supplying weapons to the various powers. For example, spain became a facist dictatorship 
        after their civil war and begain to supply Nazy Germany and her allies with various war material. The same could be said for the United States supporting Britain.
